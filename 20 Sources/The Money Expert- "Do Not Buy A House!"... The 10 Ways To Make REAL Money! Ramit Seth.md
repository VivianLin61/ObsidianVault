## Episode AI notes


1. Understanding your priorities and alignment in your rich life is crucial. **Many people have generic desires like freedom and flexibility, but haven't thought deeper about what a rich life truly means. Dissonance between desires and actions is intriguing.**
2. Owning vs Renting: Financial decisions should not be based on societal pressure or status. **Buying based on status is not practical. Ownership is valued in America, but it can be both good and bad financially.**
3. Living in a big city offers personal and professional growth opportunities. Buying a house solely as an investment may not be the best choice. **Investing in the S&P 500 historically has better returns. Considering numbers like inflation, opportunity cost, and other expenses is crucial when buying a house.**
4. Setting up an automated account structure for efficient and guilt-free spending is important. Investments should be considered as wealth accumulation and not for drawing from. Create separate savings accounts for specific goals, automate finances, and set up automatic bill payments.
5. The biggest misconception is that there is a specific formula to follow for a rich life. B**uilding a rich life requires intentionality, individuality, and ongoing effort.** Money can be used as a tool to solve problems and create an ideal life. Designing a rich life is one of the most important pieces of work we can ever do.

### [09:08] Understanding Your Priorities and Alignment in Your Rich Life


[üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (07:48 - 09:13)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b871a07c-8a8b-4e2c-958b-25d86972d4fb)

### ‚ú® Key takeaways
1. The speaker can determine someone's priorities and whether they are in alignment with their desired rich life.
2. Many people desire to do what they want, when they want, but often haven't thought beyond this trite answer.
3. Freedom is commonly cited as a desired quality, but many individuals have financial obligations that restrict their ability to truly be free.
4. The speaker finds the dissonance between people's desires and their actions to be intriguing.
5. Generic phrases like freedom and flexibility are often used to describe a rich life, but they are just empty words without deeper consideration.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>I can tell what you don't. I can tell what your priorities are. And I can also tell where you are out of alignment. So I'll give you an example. When I ask people, what is your rich life? One of the common answers they say is, I want to do what I want, when I want. I go, oh, God, not this answer again. I hear it every day. I go, wow, that's so interesting. So what do you want? They go, most people have never thought beyond a trite answer. So then the next answer I often get is freedom. I want freedom. I go, great, that sounds good. What is freedom? I want to do what I want, what I want. I look at their numbers and I see a huge payment that they're making to a 30 year mortgage. I see debt payments. I see car payments. And I go, now this is interesting. You want freedom, but you have essentially anchored yourself down to not be able to travel or to pivot or to move. How can those two be? How can you reconcile those two? And that dissonance is actually a fascinating moment. I love when we experience dissonance. We all do. I say that I want to work out more, but I don't work out more. Why? And what you'll discover is people often, they simply have never thought about it. What our rich life is, these generic phrases, freedom, flexibility, it's just words.</blockquote>

### [14:35] Owning vs Renting: The Financial Decisions and Social Pressures


[üéß Play snip - 2minÔ∏è (12:47 - 14:35)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f45cc819-cb46-4a65-a8df-0c61520e3c5c)

### ‚ú® Key takeaways
1. Ownership is highly valued in America, but it can be both a good and bad financial decision.
2. Renting is often viewed negatively in American society, leading to pressure and judgment.
3. Financial decisions should be based on individual circumstances, not societal status.
4. Buying based on status is not a practical approach.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>It's a great question. And particularly in America, we love this idea of ownership. We are taught, you've got to own. Owning a house is the best investment. It means you are successful. And if you're renting, no one really says this, but what they deep down say is you're a loser. Okay. This individualistic strain really runs deep. And it has led a lot of people to make poor financial decisions. First of all, you might be surprised to hear my view is that owning can be a good financial decision, but it also can be a very bad financial decision. In fact, I rent by choice. And living in New York, for example, I lived here for a long time. I knew that if I were to buy, I would be losing thousands of dollars every single month because it actually costs more than twice as much to own than to rent. But can you imagine the type of pressures even I got from people who would come over and say, Oh, so do you own this place? The place that I was renting. I said, no, I rent. And there was this visible moment of confusion. They're shaking my hand. They know that I'm the I will teach to be rich guy, but I rent. How can you be teaching money, but you rent? Isn't renting for losers? And I have to say, because I was rock solid confident in my decision, that pressure did not affect me. But I want to also say that a lot of us buy things based on status. Like the idea that we don't buy things based on what people around us think is nonsense.</blockquote>

### [23:22] The Benefits of Living in a Big City for Personal and Professional Growth


[üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (22:04 - 23:24)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/55a54037-ff36-4fd6-aa89-31bc9ac4bc55)

### ‚ú® Key takeaways
1. Big cities offer more job opportunities, a larger population, and access to tacit knowledge.
2. Geographical proximity to big cities can be highly beneficial for personal growth and networking.
3. Many people who buy houses haven't calculated the numbers to determine if it's a good investment.
4. Investing in the S&P 500 has historically outperformed the returns of buying a house.
5. Properly factoring in inflation, opportunity cost, and other expenses is crucial when considering the value of a house purchase.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>And typically that's a big city. So that would be where there's more jobs, where there's simply more people, if you're looking for relationships. And there's a lot of tacit knowledge that happens in big cities. Like, oh, have you tried this? Oh, have you seen that musical? Have you tried this thing, this idea that's going around? So often surrounding yourself geographically can be hugely rewarding to you as you grow. You can't do that if you bought a house because everybody told you that it was gonna be the best investment. And if I were to say, show me where you calculated the numbers that it was gonna be in a great investment, 75 plus percent of people have never created a simple spreadsheet.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>How does buying a house compare in terms of returns to something like investing in the S&P 500? It's quite poor, actually. Really?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Yeah, over about 100 years, there's great research showing that it has essentially matched inflation. It's been slightly above inflation. People find this mind-boggling. Again, because they think somebody bought a house for 100k and they sold it for a million, so it's 900k. But they don't properly factor in inflation, opportunity cost, phantom cost, all that. It's really hard to factor these numbers in, but it's critical because it's the biggest purchase of your life.</blockquote>

### [35:31] Setting up an automated account structure for efficient and guilt-free spending


[üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (34:04 - 35:30)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/6bf7ad09-bcf0-46d1-9d45-3f70c1ab9b75)

### ‚ú® Key takeaways
1. Investments are places to accumulate wealth, not to draw from like a checking account.
2. Mentally, it's important to change the way we think about our investment accounts.
3. Account structure should be optimized for better performance.
4. Automating finances can save time and effort.
5. Create separate savings accounts for specific goals.
6. Transfer money from checking to savings and then to investment account.
7. Allow the investment to grow without interference.
8. Set up automated bill payments to avoid credit card debt.
9. Initial setup may take a few weeks, but it will be hassle-free afterwards.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Oh yeah, she treated like a checking account. Investments for me are places to accumulate wealth. I don't draw from it. That's what a checking account is for. So what that is is there's two parts to what your friend is saying. One is mentally, she's thinking that this investment account is just money I can draw from if I need it. So I would sort of gently change the way she thinks about it. The second is I guarantee her account structure is a little subpar. So here's how I would set it up. This is in chapter five, it's all automation. Because trust me, I don't want to spend time transferring money back and forth. I don't spend any time on that. You get paid, your money goes into your checking account. From your checking account, it is automatically transferred to a savings account. In fact, I have sub savings accounts for vacation, car, down payment, all that stuff. So you have money set up for specific goals. Money is transferred to your investment account. It's transferred there. I'm not going to touch that money. I'm going to let it cook. And then I have my guilt free spending, which is going out with friends, whatever I love. And my credit card bill is automatically paid off every single month. That's how you want to set it up. It takes a couple of weeks to set everything up. And then you never have to think about it again.</blockquote>

6. Designing a rich life is intentional and ongoing work.
7. It is one of the most important pieces of work that we can ever do.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>I think the biggest misconception is that I have a very specific way of telling you what your rich life is. But that's not true. That comes across because people often interpret what I say about buying a house that I'm telling you, don't buy a house. Not true. I'm gonna buy a house one day myself. What I crave is encouraging someone to build their rich life with intentionality. Don't do it like me. My rich life is mine. Your rich life is never gonna look like mine. Nor should it. The misconceptions that I'm telling you follow this exact formula and you will be rich. No, follow this formula and you will have a lot of money but building a rich life takes your unique creativity and only you can do that.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Do you see that as a piece of work that we all need to do? Like the kind of the exercise that you ran me through there, do you think that everybody needs to do that initial piece of work to really sketch out what color? Of course.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Otherwise, what are we working for? You're saving money blindly. That's what the whole journal is about. You've got to know down to the intimate detail, what is my perfect Saturday? What do I not wanna do? I guarantee you, when I ask people what their perfect week looks like, zero percent say I wanna spend three hours doing laundry. I go, great, can we use money to solve that problem? Easy. Luggage in the airport. Can we use money to solve that problem? Done. We never have to think about it again. So we've got to design our rich life. It doesn't just happen to us. Nobody trips and falls and lives a rich life. It is intentional and it is ongoing work. And in my opinion, it's one of the most important pieces of work that we can ever do.</blockquote>
