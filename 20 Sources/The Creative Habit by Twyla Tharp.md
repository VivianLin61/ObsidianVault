## The Creative Habit

### Pre notes
### The Tools of the a Creative

**The Box**- This is like the capture step, you keep all the notes and inspiration and encounters you have throughout the day and store them here.

**Get Inspiration**- in order to be creative you cannot always be creating you need to find inspiration in other mediums, watch a movie go outside for walk or a museum you need to spend time discovering things.

**Fundamentals**- it is important to understand the basics and they can be used to build anything

**Finish** this means to finish to project, don't make it perfect make it done so you can move on and build the next thing. Similar to the ideas in [[The Cult of Done]]
