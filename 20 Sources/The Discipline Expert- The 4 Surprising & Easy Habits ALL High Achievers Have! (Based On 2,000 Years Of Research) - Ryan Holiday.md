<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>You're not in charge of yourself and your life, like your emotions, your thoughts, what you will do and what you won't do, it really doesn't matter what you can do. You're not free. And when you are in the sway of something, whether it's an addiction, whether it's momentum of your career, whether it's just doing what everyone else is doing, you're not free. And so creating structure and rules, it can feel limiting and you're giving up a freedom, but you're actually gaining freedom that a lot of people have never even tasted.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Seneca says, you know, we treat the body rigorously so that it is not disobedient to the mind. And I think about that, I have a cold plunge at my house. And there's supposedly all these health benefits to doing the cold plunge, you know, it increases your metabolism or circulation. You know, there's all these studies. And they're probably true. I mean, they sound like they're true. I'm not a scientist. I have no idea. But to me, all of that is extra. To me, what the cold plunge is, is that it's sitting down in the thing when I know how cold it's going to be. And I know I'm not going to get used to it or comfortable for at least a couple minutes, right? Like the cranking of the knob in the shower is the other version or the the shower is not warmed up and the forcing the step in before it's cold. That's the health benefit. Like, that's the thing that you're getting out of it is the ability to do hard stuff that you don't want to do for uncertain benefits or benefits way down the line. Like if you can cultivate that, you're golden. That's where books come from. That's where businesses come from. That's where losing weight comes from. All of it comes from the ability to do that hard thing that</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>It's like, no, the thing that's continued on, you know, I'm going to run and catch up to it. Am I going to start to build those habits again? Or am I going to, you know, write it off because it's not there anymore? Do you know what I mean? I kind of try to think about it that way. It's like just because I've had a bad week where I've over-scheduled or distracted or I was sick or whatever and I wasn't writing. That doesn't mean all is lost. Like I just have to sit down tomorrow or better. I have to sit down now and I just have to do a little bit, right? And that's what starts that process again. It's not this like all or nothing kind of a thing. And I think when you hear people talk that way, they don't realize but they're actually, it's actually very convenient to be all or nothing, right? Like that way because it's giving you an out or an off. Instead of going, yeah, I did. I didn't do what I was supposed to do the last seven days. But that doesn't say anything about right now or that doesn't say anything about tomorrow.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>What's your thoughts on how beliefs are?

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>What's your thoughts on how beliefs are? I think so much, especially recently about where our beliefs come from and how that impacts because our confidence is a belief in ourself. And then my discipline seems somewhat connected to my beliefs. And when we think about flat earth as a never beliefs and how you change their mind or how I change my mind about who I am, I think a lot about, I think if we can understand how to create belief Change, we can control much of our own hardware because my hardware seems to be this kind of identity I now believe about who Stephen Bartlett is. And I'm just kind of following the instruction manual of that belief set. So how do I change that belief about who I am?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Yeah, it is funny. There's sort of the egotism of thinking you're better than everyone. And then there's also the kind of egotism that happens where you're just obsessed with how garbage you are. You're just thinking about yourself all the time. When really you should just be thinking about what you either are or aren't doing. My friend Austin Clean talks about, he says, do the verb instead of trying to be the noun. So instead of going like, am I a writer? Am I a writer? Am I a writer? Just do the thing. Just do the thing. You are what you do. Yeah, do the thing.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Makes a lot of sense. And it's funny because there's a two way relationship there. I don't do the things that I don't think I am.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>What do the stoics say about like relationships and romantic relationships and love?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>I mean what they say about them to me is secondary to the fact that they were also in them, right? Like you know, it's one thing to be a philosopher and then it's another to get married to a person who you now live with who does things that drive you crazy and you do things that drive them Crazy and you have resentments and you have insecurities and you have compromises that you have to make. Right? I remember my wife said to me one time, this is a great question or a great way of thinking about it. I said, I said, she was frustrating me and she's kicked back a very stoic idea. She said, she said, I can't frustrate you. She was basically saying like, we're responsible for our own emotions. Like she's doing what she's doing and I am feeling the frustration. I can't make that her fault, right?</blockquote>

Yes, all the time.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Her joke is one of us is a stoic and the other writes about stoicism. She's much more naturally these things than I am, I would say. But you know, it's the idea that how you make it work in not in theory, not in your books is the whole business. You know, like I think every person has ever been married or in a relationship. You know, you get yourself in these situations where you've decided that being right is more important than being happy or than getting along or sounds like Twitter moving on.</blockquote>

I would say it's like, here's the positive thing that I did, right? I lifted heavy rocks. I went for a I did some sprinting. I went for a bike ride. I went for a run. I took a spin class, you know, whatever it is, the walk doesn't count. The walk is for the mental health. Then you gotta do something for the physical health. Okay. So four, I think we have to put something here about like we are made for each other, right? The idea of meaning comes from servicing or contributing to the common good. Mark's realist talks about the common good maybe 40, 50 times in meditations. You know, he says like we're put here for other people. Our job is to help others to, you know, leave this place better than you like leave this place better than you found it. To me, that's the meaning of life right there. So what is the positive contribution? What is the legacy you're leaving? Not how much money did you make? You know, what records did you break?</blockquote>
