How does framer motion work?
How does animate presence work?
What are layout animations?

Layout changes
changes that affect neighboring elements
CSS transforms are fast because they do require changing neighboring elements

Animate layout changes using fast css properties like transform
It inverts any layout changes done by the browser

2. Last- measure position after the layout changes happen
3.
