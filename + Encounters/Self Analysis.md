**Why am I introverted?**
Growing up in each main period of my life I only had one close friend.
When I was really young I think that was my sister, 
When I started going to Elementary, I had this one friend in elementary school from K - 2 grade but then she moved to Massachusetts
Then from 3 - 5 grade I was pretty close with Abby 
Then from 6 - 8 grade I was close with Sharon
Then from 9 - 12 grade I was basically alone, and had no close friends
Then in college I made friends with my roommates, I was pretty close with Sandy and Chris
Naturally I have always been very sensitive and probably have the [[SERT Gene]], I remember crying a lot as a child because I get overwhelmed easily by arguments, raised voices and expressions of disappointment or anger. 
Mom and Dad thought that solving the problem was just by yelling at me even more, which I don't think solved the problem and just made me close off to them more. 
Small things make me cry, sometimes even playing with my friends I would end up crying.
I remember this one time, in middle school my friends took my glasses and started running around with it and I cried because I couldn't see.
In elementary school, this girl kept hitting me with her long hair and I ended up crying.
In 4th grade when I had to present my project in front on the class I cried during the presentation because the person sitting right in front of me said that they couldn't hear me. 
I think that caused to learn to hide my feelings from them and basically taught me to not express my self. 
Which explains why I am not a very expressive person and very closed off from other people.

Socially I am also very sensitive, a lot of people seem to stress me out, I remember in college freshmen, year the beginning of the semester i would literally get nosebleeds everynight because of all the people I was meeting. My face was always red and my heart was always beating so fast. 



Why don't I feel lonely?
I have felt lonely when I am alone, I think I have felt more lonely around other people that I have when I am alone. 
The most lonely period of my life was high school, 
I never get bored, I because I have some many questions, I have so many books I want to read and things I want to build and learn, I actually get confused when people say they are bored. 
The immense computational power and energy required to develop semi-intelligent systems like ChatGPT are staggering. Yet, our brains naturally possess incredible cognitive capabilities, which we often take for granted. Instead of harnessing this potential, many people spend their time mindlessly scrolling through TikTok or watching TV, allowing their brains to atrophy rather than using them to their fullest extent.


**Questions**

My solution to find the almost perfect partner. 
One problem I had was I know that I am not ready now but how will I know when I will be ready. I think I will be ready when I have fully figured out my self and who I want to be, what my values are and what i like and what I dislike and stuff like. 
I will basically create a document about me, and once that is done, I think i would be ready, that means I have thought and written down about all of those things and know a lot about my self..

It doesn't make sense how most people just choose a partner because someone like them or because their heart beats faster when they are with them.
Of course that is the case we are animals and in our brains we are programmed to reproduce. So if someone likes you, your brain doesn't think about if they are a good person or if they are compatible with you, it tricks you into thinking that are so that it can reproduce. 

There is not finding the right person, you just have to become the right person and right person will show up at some point/


Why i quit social media
I don't feel FOMO because I know that I wouldn't want to be there and in that situation, if you show me some one having fun at party i don't feel FOMO because i know i wouldn't have fun at the party
All social media does is to tell you what to like, what to think, how to feel, but I don't want some algorithm to tell me these things, I want to naturally figure out my self, I want to know naturally what I will become interested in.

I have not been feeling good the past few days, I think it is definitely my eating habits, I think that is the issue that is affecting my focus, I will try tommorrow to eat protein in the morning immediately when I wake up and then have my eggs for breakfast, I think that I can’t focus because of my bad eating habits, I don’t actually eat therefore I feel hungry, but when I “eat” I still feel hungry and I think my brain I just confused,
Tommorrow my plan is wake up drink protein, eat eggs and then go exercise no execses, this should be for about an hour and start the book cue project until daily stand up, wake up at 6 - 15 breakfast, exercise until like 7-30 and then from 7-30 to like 930 am work on you app,  (this is the morning I want everyday )
Then gm stuff and then Cigna stuff and workout again (watch a tutorial or tsomething ) after lunch and then work on learning new things

It’s actually annoying how bad my focus is a I really need to fix it, it’s actually become a problem that is affecting my mental state

Everything meaningless, but that doesn't mean it isn't worth it

**Money**
I want to spend as little time thinking about money as possible

I want to build apps not because I want to make a lot of money it is because I like it and because what is the alternative. I am really lucky that I was so able to so quickly find something that I am pretty good at and enjoy doing more that most people so why not spend more time doing it. What is the alternative any way. spending all my time sitting around watching TV? I know that won't make me happy.
The goal is just to continue to build apps that I think are cool and other people will use. I am human and there probably thousands of people that are just like me. 
Salaries and money are byproducts of ambition not because they were your primary desire.
If your primary desire is to make as much money as possible



**Values**
Ambitious- I want to be a more capable person who is fully independent and does not nee the help of others.
