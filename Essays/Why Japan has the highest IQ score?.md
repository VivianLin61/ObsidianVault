### DHA During Development

- Early humans were able to get [[Docosahexaenoic acid]](DHA).
- DHA is best found in seafood.
- A shore-based diet was important for the development of the brain.
- Helps development of the prefrontal cortex.
- Reduces ADHD, helps with attention.
- Makes sense why dolphins are so smart because they get so much DHA.
- Humans may have evolved from aquatic apes, which is why we are so smart.
- The diet of Japanese people has so much DHA, which is why they have higher IQs.

### Linoleic Acid and Its Effects

- [[Linoleic acid]] makes you dumb; it hogs up space in the brain cells so DHA cannot get in. It shoves out DHA and other fats that are good for your brain.
- Vegetable oil reduces DHA because it has so much linoleic acid.
- People in Japan consume about half the vegetable oil that we do in America.
