**How to break in shoes**

  

I put on my shoes, hot shower water on them for 30 sec, walk around or sit with them on for 15 min, redo. Took about 4 redoes but now my shoes fit perfectly.



  

Resoler here... Never EVER put your shoes in the oven. Chemicals in the glue are heat activated and this may lead to delamination. For the record, we use heat to remove the old soles a from your shoes when we resole. Sportiva shoes in particular react badly to heat. Can’t really believe that they are actually recommending this on a climbing video!!! Jeez!

  

or synthetic shoes, you can use the hot air method (50*C oven for few minutes). The way it works is by softening the glue and alloging the piecies to move a little to accomodate to your feet. But It can also damage the shoes and comprimise their durability so user discretion is advised.

  

Wear your shoes in an extremely hot shower and let the hot water douse the shoes for 20 minutes with them on. It'll feel weird, but it works! It also does not damage the shoes. Let them dry obviously until you use them.

Try this trick. Wear them under a hot shower, have them on for as long as you can, then stuff them with paper and let them dry slowly. Not under direct heat or they will shrink.

  

Wear the shoe put them in a bucket of hot water for 5 minutes, then walk around and keep them on for as long as you can,

Then take them off and stuff it with paper until they dry, or sleep with them on?

  

 warm water will do just fine. The important thing is to wear the shoes for at least two to four hours while they are wet. They then fit perfectly, or at least they did for me.

Remove all of the packaging from your new shoes. Take your new rock-climbing shoes out of the box. Make sure you remove all packaging and stickers that might be in the shoe or on the sole.

Freeze your shoes. Take two zip-lock bags (one for each shoe) and fill them with water until they are roughly the size of your foot. Put the [bags](https://www.gearpatrol.com/style/a198853/best-weekender-bags-every-getaway/) filled with water into your climbing shoes and lace them loosely around the bags. Put your shoes into the freezer and leave them overnight.

Let your shoes thaw. Take the shoes out of the freezer and let them thaw. The water will have expanded as it froze, stretching the shoe in the process. This process works in smaller increments than the shower method, so if your shoes need more stretching faster, opt for the shower.

Repeat as needed. It may take a few repetitions of the process to get your shoes to the point where the upper is stretched to the point where it is comfortable on your foot.

  

Wait until water is warm so it does not burn and then put your feet in 

Tomorrow morning boil some water, wear the shoe and put the show in the water for 5-10 minutes, take the shoe out and keep them on for 2-3 hours
