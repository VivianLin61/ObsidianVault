## docker container

 An instance of an [[Docker Image]] that runs as an isolated process on the host machine. Lightweight executable package with everything you need to run an application.
Containers are **mutable** and can be changed 

```
docker run -d --name my-container ubuntu:latest  # Runs a container from the Ubuntu image
docker stop my-container                         # Stops the running container
docker rm my-container                           # Removes the container
```

**Container Lifecycle**
Created from images, run, stopped, and removed.
