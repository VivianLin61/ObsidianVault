## You inner roommate is the cause of all you problems


You inner roommate is extremely neurotic and causes basically all you problems. 
- For example you buy a new car you always wanted, but all you inner roommate and hear and see all its imperfections and is constantly repeat them to you. If your friend said these things to you after your purchase you would tell them to shut up.
To overcome them you need personally externally and think of it as somebody with it's own body and mind. 

The more you listen and watch your roommate you will realize how much bad advice it gives you.
