[Easing | GSAP | Docs & Learning](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Eases/#:~:text=GSAP%20uses%20a%20default%20ease,set%20defaults%20for%20particular%20timelines.)


Ease determines the **rate of change** of the animation.

The beginning of the animation the rate of change the animation is step and flattens out.

Power easing
	Easing functions are based on the power curves. They are used for animations that require smooth acceleration and deceleration
power.out (fast, slow)
power.in (slow, fast)
power.inOut(slow, fast, slow)



Bounce easing
	Mimics the motion of a bouncing object in the animation. Causes the property to overshoot and then bounce back, this is used for playful or elastic animations where you want a **spring like effect**
