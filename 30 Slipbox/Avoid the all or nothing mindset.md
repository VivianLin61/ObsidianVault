### Avoid the all or nothing mindset

Just because you have a bad day, or a bad week, doesn't mean that all progress is lost. Maybe you were distracted, not focused or disciplined. The fact that you had a bad morning doesn't say anything about right now or tomorrow. **You can choose to start to be better right now**.

It's convenient to have this mindset because it's giving you a way out. It gives you a reason to give up.
