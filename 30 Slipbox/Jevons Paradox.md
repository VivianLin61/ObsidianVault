## Jevons Paradox


Jevons observed that a more efficient steam engine design increase coal consumption rather than decrease.

More efficient technology, lowers the costs and motivates more consumptions.
This extra consumption can even exceed the initial efficiency savings.

This paradox can be applied to time management, even you try to optimize and and be more productive, we tend to still use that extra time "saved" to doing additional work

For example if you work in the emergency room, with a line of patients, it is unnecessary to optimize everything to get see more patients because there will always be more patients.
