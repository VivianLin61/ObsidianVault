## 7 ways to recharge your batteries and avoid burnout

Burnout occurs when we don't have enough rest.

**Physical rest**: sleeping, stretching yoga
**Mental rest**: Break from work and phone
Sensory rest: 
**Creative rest**: Doing something that allows you to express yourself. Painting, writing, creating music. 
Sensory rest: Rest from sensory stimulation like noise and light. Take a simple walk in nature. 
Emotional rest: Mindfulness practice. Feeling calm, centered and at peace.
**Social Rest**: surround yourself with positive people who support you and make you feel good.
Spiritual rest: connecting with something bigger than yourself. Religion, or spending time in nature.


Most important to me are:
Physical, Mental, Creative and Social rest
Physical rest: I will get 8 hours of sleep every night
Mental rest: After 7pm I will not think about work or coding at all.
Creative rest: learning to draw
